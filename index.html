  <h2>A Little about Me</h2>
  <font color="red">
    I am William Andres Romero, but now it is Romero. At least that is what everyone now calls me in college. I went to Woodward Academy and live right by the school in College Park, GA. I learned a lot in high school, and I had many leadership positions. I was lucky enough to get a bid from Sigma Chi at UGA, and pledged the first couple months. I did not have time to apply to be part of student government, but I plan on doing it next year. I really enjoy being involved with every organization as I was my pledge class treasurer, and I plan on trying to be a part of IFC and many more organizations while attending UGA. I am an intended-fiance major and plan on attending the Terry Business School. I have really enjoyed attending UGA thus far, and I can not wait what my future holds for me here at this university.</div>

  <h2>Sports</h2>
</font>
  Throughout my entire life, I have loved to play sports. I have played soccer, hockey, lacrosse, football, cross country, and wrestled. My main sport throughout middle and high school was lacrosse. I was the starting Varisty goalie by the end of my freshman year, and I was a captain my sophomore to senior year. Although I have played lacrosse most, my favorite pick up sport to play is soccer. I really enjoy the simplicity of the sport, and the fact that you can play soccer almost anywhere. I play pick up soccer with my pledge brothers usually 3 times a week, and the ingenious invention of the game, soccer tennis, has contributed to hours of the fun. </div>

  <h2>My Family</h2>
  <font color="black">
    The Romero household is made up of my mom, my little sister, my older sister, and me. My sisters and I are half Colombian and half white. We are all able to understand Spanish pretty well, but only my older sister is fluent. My Spanish is broken, but I am able to communicate and hold conversation. Meanwhile my youngest sister speaks the least amount of Spanish of the three of us. Other very important memebers of my family are my two dogs, Kipper and Skip, and my cat, Piper. They are a rowdy bunch that love to mess with eachother as well as being the center of attention.
